# Borders: A KMail header theme

![alt text](Screenshot.png)

This header theme is a mild variation of the theme "KMail 5.2" that seems to ship by default (at least on most distros). It better separates the header and body of the message and looks better to my eye.

Changes:
- Header and body given borders with 6px radius and shadows
- Subject title font reduced and given a weight of 500
- Date weight reduced to normal (from bold) and made black for better contrast
- No hardcoded colors
- Minimum padding so that screen space isn't wasted

To install, copy the folder "borders" to ~/.local/share/messageviewer/themes/, restart KMail, and select the header theme "Borders".
